# nlptagger
This project is heavily under construction and will change a lot because I am learning as I am making and accuracy isn't #1 right now.


When you need a program to understand context of commands.

# nlptagger

A versatile, high-performance Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkit written entirely in **Go** (Golang). The project provides a command-line utility for training and utilizing foundational NLP models, including **Word2Vec** embeddings, a sophisticated **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** model, and a practical **Intent Classifier**.

-----

## ‚ú® Key Features

The application is structured as a dispatcher that runs specialized modules for various NLP tasks:

  * **Word2Vec Training**: Generate high-quality distributed word representations (embeddings) from a text corpus.
  * **Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture**: Train a powerful MoE model, designed for improved performance, scalability, and handling of complex sequential or structural data.
  * **Intent Classification**: Develop a model for accurately categorizing user queries into predefined semantic intents.
  * **Efficient Execution**: Built in Go, leveraging its performance and concurrency features for fast training and inference.

-----

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a working **Go environment** (version 1.18 or higher is recommended) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/golangast/nlptagger.git
    cd nlptagger
    ```

-----

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

The main executable (`main.go`) controls all operations using specific command-line flags. All commands should be run from the root directory of the project.

### 1\. Training Models

Use the respective flags to initiate the training process. Each flag executes a separate module located in the `cmd/` directory.

| Model | Flag | Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Word2Vec** | `--train-word2vec` | `go run main.go --train-word2vec` |
| **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** | `--train-moe` | `go run main.go --train-moe` |
| **Intent Classifier** | `--train-intent-classifier` | `go run main.go --train-intent-classifier` |

### 2\. Running MoE Inference

To run predictions using a previously trained MoE model, use the `--moe_inference` flag and pass the input query string.

| Action | Flag | Command Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MoE Inference** | `--moe_inference` | `go run main.go --moe_inference "schedule a meeting with John for tomorrow at 2pm"` |

### 3\. Help / No Action

If no flags are provided, the application will prompt the user to specify an action:

```
$ go run main.go
2025/10/05 07:35:00 No action specified. Use -train-word2vec, -train-moe, -train-intent-classifier, or -moe_inference <query>.
```

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure (Inferred)

The architecture is modular, with the main file dispatching tasks to specialized packages in the `cmd/` directory. This separation ensures clean code and independent development of model components.

```
nlptagger/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go                       # Main entry point and command dispatcher.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod                        # Go module file.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/                          # Directory for all specialized command-line modules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train_word2vec/           # Handles all Word2Vec training logic.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train_moe/                # Handles all MoE training and model saving logic.
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train_intent_classifier/  # Handles all Intent Classifier training logic.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ moe_inference/            # Handles MoE model loading and prediction logic.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                           # Other internal packages (models, utils, data handling, etc.)
```

-----

## üìä Data & Configuration (Inferred)

While not specified in `main.go`, training modules typically require input data and configuration.

  * **Data Structure**: Training modules are assumed to look for data files (e.g., plain text corpus, JSON/CSV files for labeled data) in pre-defined locations (e.g., a `data/` directory or specified via internal configuration flags).
  * **Configuration**: Model hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, vector size, etc.) are likely managed either through configuration files (e.g., `config.json`, YAML) within the `cmd/` sub-packages or additional flags not exposed by `main.go`.
  * **Model Output**: Trained models are saved to disk, typically in a `models/` directory, for later use by the inference module.

## Why Go?
* The language is done since 1.0.https://youtu.be/rFejpH_tAHM there are little features that get added after 10 years but whatever you learn now will forever be useful.
* It also has a compatibility promise https://go.dev/doc/go1compat
* It was also built by great people. https://hackernoon.com/why-go-ef8850dc5f3c
* 14th used language https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021
* Highest starred language https://github.com/golang/go
* It is also number 1 language to go to and not from https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/#Do-you-plan-to-adopt--migrate-to-other-languages-in-the-next--months-If-so-to-which-ones
