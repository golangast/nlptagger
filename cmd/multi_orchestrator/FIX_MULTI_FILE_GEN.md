# Fix: Generating Multi-File Structures

## Problem

The user requested "add a handler.go file", but the orchestrator was generating a single `server.go` file with the handler embedded inside. This happened because the code generation logic was ignoring the detailed file structure (e.g., separate `handler.go`) provided by the semantic templates and falling back to a monolithic generation function.

## Solution

I implemented a new generation function `generateFromSemantic` that:
1.  **Reads the Semantic Output**: It looks at the structured resource tree (folders, files, content) generated by the templates.
2.  **Creates Files Recursively**: It iterates through the tree and creates the actual files and folders on the disk.
3.  **Prioritizes Semantic Generation**: The main loop now checks if the semantic output contains a file structure. If so, it uses `generateFromSemantic` to create the exact files requested (e.g., `main.go`, `handler.go`). If not, it falls back to the old logic.

## Result

Now, when a template defines multiple files (like the `webserver` template which has `main.go`, `handler.go`, `templates/`, `static/`), the orchestrator will actually create all of them as separate files/folders.

## Files Modified

- `cmd/multi_orchestrator/main.go`:
  - Added `generateFromSemantic` function.
  - Updated generation loop to use `generateFromSemantic` when appropriate.

## Try It

```bash
./cmd/multi_orchestrator/multi_orchestrator
> create a webserver named jim
```
This should now create `main.go` AND `handler.go` separately!
